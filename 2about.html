          <p>It’s hard to read a girl’s mind and know what she really <br>
   wants in life, but there are certain things every 20-something <br>
   girl wants in life. When you are in your 20s, you need to adopt <br>
   ]many important habits and get rid of old ones. You need to set <br>
   your life goals and think of the ways to reach them. You need to <br>
   learn how to take smart decisions and take responsibilities. In fact,<br>
   there are many things every woman should do before she turns 30, but <br>
   these 12 are just some of the most desirable things every 20-something <br>
   girl wants in life.</p>
